<p>Richmond&mdash;Capital of the Cavaliers&mdash;a city that is mellow and
yet modern, where the rustle of the past may still be heard amid the
bustle of the present.</p>
<p>To appreciate Richmond one must, before all else, remember that this
old town has roots planted deep in the history of our country. Richmond
was founded in 1737 by William Byrd II, of Westover on the James, forefather
of two of Virginia&rsquo;s illustrious sons of today, Admiral Richard Evelyn
Byrd and Senator Harry Flood Byrd. But even before Father Byrd laid off
his lots and established Richmond, this site at the falls of the James River
had held a certain degree of importance. Just a few weeks after the Virginia
settlers landed at Jamestown on May 13, 1607, to found the first permanent
English settlement in America, Captain Newport pushed off up the James
to find the route to the gold of the Indies. The barrier of rocks, known as
the falls of the James, must have been an unwelcome sight to the eyes of
that little band of intrepid explorers as it shattered their dream of easy passage
to their expected El Dorado. Captain Newport, however, was the first
of the Virginians to believe that no hoped-for golden future should stop a
man from doing the sensible, practical things of the moment. Before very
long, Captain Francis West had established a frontier post at the point
where the falls interrupted further navigation of the river. It is hard to
realize that Richmond was once on the western frontier of our country, but
such was the case until about 1660, when settlers began that westward push
that only ended when the Pacific was reached.</p>
<p>Richmond has seen much of the thrilling history of our country unfold.
She was a promising village when George Washington and the son of her
founder, Colonel Byrd, successfully led Virginia&rsquo;s two regiments with the
troops of her sister colonies and the British regulars in the French and Indian
war. She was hostess to that brilliant group of patriots who gathered in
St. John&rsquo;s Church in 1775 to discuss what methods could be taken to avert
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
war with England, only to have Patrick Henry, grown sick of futile measures
which obtained no justice for the colonists, rise to advocate the arming of
the Virginia militia and utter those words which made him the embodiment
of man&rsquo;s immortal will to freedom: &ldquo;Give me liberty or give me death.&rdquo;
She was the capital of the State from which Thomas Jefferson, Governor
of Virginia, had to flee to prevent capture when Benedict Arnold swooped
down on Richmond in 1781 and occupied the city for the British in America&rsquo;s
war for independence. Cornwallis visited it later in the same year. She
was a thriving center of commerce in 1812 when the city was often alarmed
by the news that the British were coming again, and in 1846 when her
&ldquo;Grays&rdquo; were accepted for service in the Mexican War. She was the capital
of the Confederate States of America from 1861-65, the hope of the South
and the despair of the North for those four long, bloody, heart-breaking
years. The best commanders, the most immense armies the Federal government
could furnish, hammered, hammered at Richmond, while the South&rsquo;s
bravest hearts and keenest minds stood with their backs often at the very
walls of the city, but would not let them pass. No city in America ever has
or ever will be again so completely the goal of the whole American people.
Those years and the ones that followed taught Richmond something that
as a city she will never forget&mdash;that courage can rise above everything. The
incredible sacrifices of Richmond people in that time knit the citizens together
with bonds that even time cannot sunder. She was again prompt to
the call of duty in 1898 when the country was challenged with outside danger,
and once more poured forth her sons and funds in World War I; also
in World War II she gave liberally of her sons and daughters and resources.</p>
<p>Those wars through which Richmond has lived are but distressing landmarks
on the long trail our country has traveled. Her contribution has been
equally as great in times of peace. In fact, probably her greatest contribution
has been her way of life&mdash;a way based on the belief that the best of the
old must be kept and adapted to fit in with the best of the new. The city
has grown steadily; has been rebuilt after three destructions by fire. Today
Richmond is a commercial, industrial, financial, medical and educational
center of the South, and one of the fastest growing industrial centers in the
nation. Richmond&rsquo;s industry has been stable and resistant to wide fluctuations
in business cycle.</p>
<p>Cities, after all, are but larger patterns of individual people. People who
have been tested by time and tribulation and yet come out smiling, full of
faith and courage, never fail to command our admiration. That Richmond
has done this, we submit as our plea for your appreciation of our old city.</p>
<p>The people of Richmond have made the city and in turn been made by
it. No one can long live in the mellowness of Richmond without feeling
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
that here is a calm that is not dead but gay, an ease and a friendliness that
is real and not assumed, a determination to build always for the future but
never to forget the heritage of the past which is our inspiration, a will to
be of such a quality that we cannot fail to give strength to the nation, going
always forward in the spirit of those who would surmount the obstacles of
the present in order to attain goals inspired by ideals of right and justice.</p>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">A Tour of Historic Richmond</span></h2>
<p>Happily, Richmond has preserved much of her charm of a bygone day,
despite the fact that she has kept step with the times. Innumerable shrines remain
to remind the visitor of the dramatic part played by the city in the
making of the nation. In virtually every quarter of the town will be found
reminders of the past&mdash;public buildings, homes and gardens, memorials to
her sons and daughters; in short, showplaces of wide interest to those who
would acquaint themselves with the history of a section visited by Englishmen
soon after the establishment of a settlement at Jamestown.</p>
<p>The tour has been planned on a geographic basis to permit as much as
possible to be seen. It is almost impossible to sightsee chronologically in Richmond,
as our forefathers built where they wished and not according to a
city plan. The result is that the old buildings of Richmond are scattered
quite widely. Leaving the heart of the city, we drive to the intersection of
Third and Main streets and proceed south on Third to the end of the street,
where we come to Gamble&rsquo;s Hill Park.</p>
<h3 id="c3">Gamble&rsquo;s Hill Park</h3>
<p>Below you rolls &ldquo;the mighty James,&rdquo; the father of Virginia&rsquo;s history, along
the banks of which Richmond had her beginning. In 1645 Fort Charles
was erected here at the falls of the James to protect the Tidewater settlers
from the incursions of the Indians. The cross, planted on rugged boulders
or river-jacks from the James, was erected here by the Association for the
Preservation of Virginia Antiquities in memory of the valiant little group
of explorers, who landed on an island below this point on May 24, 1607.</p>
<p>Across the ravine on the extreme right is the State penitentiary, ably run
along modern lines.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>Bringing your eyes along the crest of the same hill sloping down towards
the river, you will see Hollywood Cemetery, where lie buried two Presidents
of the United States, James Monroe and John Tyler; the President of the
Confederate States of America, Jefferson Davis; General J. E. B. Stuart,
Commodore Matthew Fontaine Maury, &ldquo;the pathfinder of the seas;&rdquo; Fitzhugh
Lee (General R. E. Lee is buried in Lexington, Virginia); George E.
Pickett and some 18,000 Confederate soldiers, including the Virginians who
fell in Pickett&rsquo;s charge at Gettysburg.</p>
<p>Immediately beneath Gamble&rsquo;s Hill curve are the remains of the once
vital Kanawha Canal, Virginia&rsquo;s earliest great westward transportation
system, of which George Washington was the first president in 1785.</p>
<p>Across the canal is the Tredegar Company, iron manufacturers, which
has rounded out more than a century of service, having furnished munitions
in the country&rsquo;s last four wars. Here was rolled the armor-plate for the
&ldquo;Merrimac,&rdquo; which, with the &ldquo;Monitor,&rdquo; made history in Hampton Roads
in the first battle between iron-clads.</p>
<p>Leaving the park we pass on our left a remarkable structure, known as
Pratt&rsquo;s castle, constructed in the 1850&rsquo;s. &para; <i>Proceed on Fourth Street to
Canal, right on Canal to Fifth, left on Fifth to Main.</i></p>
<h3 id="c4">Old Homes</h3>
<p>Here on Fifth Street, between Cary and Main, are several examples of the
stately houses which made life in Richmond in the nineteenth century the
gracious thing that it was. On your right are two old homes which have
passed from the hands of the families that built and loved them. At the
southeast corner of Main and Fifth Streets used to stand the Allan home
where Edgar Allan Poe lived to young manhood with his foster parents. On
the northwest corner of Fifth and Main Streets is an interesting octagonal
house, built prior to 1814 by an early mayor of Richmond. &para; <i>Proceed on
Fifth to Franklin, right on Franklin to 707 East Franklin.</i></p>
<h3 id="c5">General Lee&rsquo;s Home</h3>
<p>This upright house, typical of many built by the wealthier Richmonders in
the early nineteenth century, was lent to General Robert E. Lee as a home
for himself when he could be in Richmond and for his family during the
latter years of the War Between the States. It is now the home of the Virginia
Historical Society, which has built a fireproof structure in the rear
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
for its priceless collection of papers. Many interesting things on view here
merit a visit. &para; <i>Proceed east on Franklin to Ninth Street.</i></p>
<h3 id="c6">Federal Reserve Bank</h3>
<p>On your left, from Eighth to Ninth on Franklin Street, is situated the Federal
Reserve Bank for the Fifth District, which embraces Virginia, North
Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland, the District of Columbia, and part
of West Virginia. &para; <i>Intersection of Franklin and Ninth.</i></p>
<h3 id="c7">Old Bell Tower</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig2">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="667" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Old Bell Tower</i></p>
</div>
<p>Here you get your first view of the State Capitol and its grounds, but at this
time confine your interest to the quaint structure directly ahead. It is the old
Bell Tower, built in 1824 to replace the wooden tower from which had pealed
forth the call to colors for regular and volunteer troops to defend Richmond
from expected attacks. &para; <i>Right on Ninth to Main Street.</i></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<h3 id="c8">Financial District</h3>
<p>You are now in the heart of Richmond&rsquo;s financial district. Many banking
houses, however, are situated in other parts of the city.</p>
<h3 id="c9">Post Office</h3>
<p>One block to your left, on Main Street is the Federal building in which are
located the United States Post Office and customs house. A part of this
building was erected before the War Between the States and housed the
executive offices of President Jefferson Davis and several members of his
cabinet. Next to it is the city&rsquo;s parcel post building. &para; <i>Proceed south
on Ninth Street across Main to Canal, left on Canal to Fourteenth, right on
Fourteenth to Bridge, halt.</i></p>
<h3 id="c10">Site of John Smith Landing</h3>
<p>Before you stretches one of the four bridges connecting Richmond&rsquo;s north
and south sides of the James River. Beyond the bridge, near the huge grain
elevator, is where Capt. John Smith first landed in Richmond. The land
was originally purchased from Chief Powhatan. &para; <i>Back (north) on Fourteenth
to Main and right on Main to Fifteenth.</i></p>
<h3 id="c11">Southern Literary Messenger</h3>
<p>The southeast corner on your right is the site of the <i>Southern Literary Messenger</i>
Building, where Edgar Allan Poe edited that magazine to enduring
fame. Across the street is the site of Bell Tavern, one of the famous places
of rendezvous in early Richmond and recruiting station during the War of
1812. &para; <i>Continue east on Main to Seventeenth.</i></p>
<h3 id="c12">Old First Market</h3>
<p>Passing the Main Street Station (C. &amp; O. and Seaboard) on the left, you
come to the Old Market. On this site, from the earliest days, the farmers
would gather to sell their produce to the city folk. To the left of the market,
Negro washerwomen used to spread their wash on the grassy bank of
Shockoe Creek, the frequent floods of which were the chief excitement of
the old town. The women chatted and lightened their work by singing.
The darkies&rsquo; melodious voices, blending with the cries of the food hawkers,
must have made the market the gayest spot in Richmond. &para; <i>Continue on
Main, halting three-fourths of the way between Nineteenth and Twentieth.</i></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<h3 id="c13">Poe Shrine</h3>
<p>On your left is the oldest house in Richmond, erected about 1686. On the
front wall may be seen the letters &ldquo;J.R.,&rdquo; supposed to signify &ldquo;Jacobus Rex,&rdquo;
James II, who was then King of England. The building is now a part of
the Edgar Allan Poe Foundation, which includes also the small buildings
on the left and right, in the three of which are housed much Poe material
and many articles relating to his residence in Richmond. In the rear is an
&ldquo;enchanted garden&rdquo; which leads to a classical loggia, built chiefly of material
from the former <i>Southern Literary Messenger</i> building. &para; <i>Turn
right on Twentieth to Cary.</i></p>
<div class="img" id="fig3">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="528" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Poe Shrine</i></p>
</div>
<h3 id="c14">Libby Prison</h3>
<p>On the southeast corner of Cary stood Libby Prison, where thousands of
Federal prisoners were confined during the War Between the States. The
old warehouse-prison building was torn down and taken to Chicago to be
rebuilt for the World&rsquo;s Fair of 1893.</p>
<p>You are now in the heart of the tobacco district of Richmond. For blocks
may be seen Richmond&rsquo;s famous &ldquo;Tobacco Row.&rdquo; &para; <i>Turn left on Cary
to Twenty-first, left on Twenty-first to Main, left on Main to Eighteenth
Street; right on Eighteenth one block to Franklin.</i></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<h3 id="c15">Oldest Masonic Hall</h3>
<p>The wooden building on the right is the oldest Masonic hall in continuous
use in the United States which was built originally for Masonic purposes.
Governor Edmund Randolph was among the many prominent Virginia
Masons who participated in the corner-stone laying in 1785. Lafayette was
given a reception here in 1824 on his triumphal return visit to the scenes
where he had served in the American Revolution. &para; <i>Proceed east on
Franklin, halting briefly between Twenty-first and Twenty-second.</i></p>
<p>At the top of the hill to your left, you can see a typical old galleried home
of early Richmond, now incorporated in the buildings of Monte Maria
Roman Catholic Convent. &para; <i>Turn right on Franklin at Twenty-third, go
to Main, turn right, then proceed to Twenty-first Street, turn right and
continue north to Broad, turn right on Broad, continue to Twenty-fourth.</i></p>
<p>You are now entering Church Hill, Richmond&rsquo;s oldest residential section.
&para; <i>Stop at Twenty-fourth and Broad, location of St. John&rsquo;s Church.</i></p>
<h3 id="c16">St. John&rsquo;s Church (<span class="smaller"><a href="#cover"><i>Front Cover</i></a></span>)</h3>
<p>St. John&rsquo;s Episcopal Church, built in 1741, the oldest in the city, will forever
be famous as the place where Patrick Henry uttered his ringing challenge
for &ldquo;Liberty or Death&rdquo; to the American colonists. The second Virginia convention
met in St. John&rsquo;s, because it was the largest hall in Richmond, in
March, 1775, and even at that, the original was not half the size of the
enlarged present-day structure. It is worth your while to get out here and
let the sexton show you the church and tell you briefly of its story. On the
left, as you face the church, you will see the grave of Elizabeth Arnold Poe,
the tiny actress-mother of America&rsquo;s great imaginative writer. Young Edgar
Poe is said to have been found more than once lying sobbing on his mother&rsquo;s
grave. &para; <i>Proceed east on Broad to Twenty-eighth; right on Twenty-eighth
two blocks to Franklin.</i></p>
<h3 id="c17">Soldiers and Sailors Monument</h3>
<p>Here, at Libby Hill Park, is the Soldiers and Sailors Monument, erected in
1894 as a memorial to the soldiers and sailors of the Confederacy. The figure
on the top is by William L. Sheppard. &para; <i>Return to Broad Street; turn
left on Broad, halting between Thirteenth and Twelfth.</i></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<h3 id="c18">Monumental Church</h3>
<p>This unusual-looking Episcopal church structure was built in 1812 as a
memorial to more than seventy persons, including the Governor of Virginia,
who lost their lives in a fire which destroyed a theatre on this site on December
26, 1811. In this theatre Edgar Allan Poe&rsquo;s mother had acted a few
short months before, and in this same theatre the Virginia Convention of
1788 had ratified the Federal Constitution. &para; <i>Proceed west on Broad
(Passing Medical College of Virginia Hospital Building) to Twelfth, turn
right on Twelfth to Marshall, turn right on Marshall to center of block.</i></p>

<p class="pcap"><i>The Egyptian Building &middot; Medical College of Virginia</i></p>
</div>
<h3 id="c19">Medical College of Virginia</h3>
<p>You are now in the center of the buildings of the Medical College of Virginia
which cover several city blocks. Particularly notable is the concrete building
on your right at the end of the block which is stated to be &ldquo;the most
perfect example of Egyptian architecture in America.&rdquo; Erected in 1845, it
is the earliest in the Medical College group. This is one of the oldest medical
schools in the South and the only one to remain open during the War
Between the States. The buildings now composing the Medical College
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
group afford not only an imposing sight but with their facilities contribute
greatly to the importance of Richmond as one of the leading medical centers
of the country. &para; <i>Circle block to right, returning to Twelfth. Proceed
north on Twelfth two blocks to Clay, turn right on Clay.</i></p>
<h3 id="c20">Confederate Museum</h3>
<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/p06.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="441" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Confederate Museum (White House of the Confederacy)</i></p>
</div>
<p>This building, now the Confederate Museum, was the White House of the
Confederacy from 1861-65. Here lived President Jefferson Davis. Here
came the generals to confer, the couriers bearing news of the various battles.
Most fittingly, the women of the South have made this a treasure-house
of things Confederate. In the museum you may now see the uniforms,
swords, camp chest and multitudinous relics of Generals Robert E. Lee,
Thomas J. (&ldquo;Stonewall&rdquo;) Jackson, Joseph E. Johnston, J. E. B. Stuart and
most of the other Confederate heroes. The student of that phase of our history
finds here invaluable historical papers and files. &para; <i>Make a U-turn
and proceed west on Clay to Eleventh.</i></p>
<h3 id="c21">Valentine Museum</h3>
<p>This Museum of the Life and History of Richmond, founded by Mann S.
Valentine and opened in 1898, now includes four 19th century buildings.
The Wickham-Valentine House, designed by Robert Mills in 1812, is a
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
notable example of late Georgian architecture, with furnishings of that
period and of 1853, and with a walled garden that is restful and beautiful
in all seasons. The adjoining Museum building contains a growing collection
of permanent Richmond exhibits and the largest costume department in the
south. The Indian collection emphasizes archaeological material from
Virginia and North Carolina. Changing exhibitions illustrate past and present
city activities and interests. Facing the garden is the Studio of the
sculptor, Edward V. Valentine. The Bransford-Cecil Memorial House, in
the Greek Revival style of the 1840&rsquo;s, contains a gallery-lecture room; a
Research Library, with extensive pictorial material illustrating Richmond&rsquo;s
history; and the School Services&rsquo; office and workrooms, where two staff
members carry on an organized statewide program of lectures, loans, and
special projects for children. &para; <i>Proceed west on Clay to Eighth, turn left
Eighth to Marshall, turn left on Marshall.</i></p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Wickham-Valentine House</i></p>
</div>
<h3 id="c22">John Marshall House</h3>
<p>On the northwest corner of Ninth and Marshall is John Marshall House.
This house, severely simple on the exterior, boasts a classic dignity inside
which proves that John Marshall, as well as his politically different cousin,
Thomas Jefferson, could design homes. The eminent jurist himself designed
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
this home. The house is now the property of the Association for the Preservation
of Virginia Antiquities, the first of such societies in America. It is
furnished with some of Marshall&rsquo;s original furniture. You may see here
the robe which Marshall wore as Chief Justice of the United States. The
large structure to the rear of the house is John Marshall High School, one
of Richmond&rsquo;s two public high schools. &para; <i>Continue on Marshall to Tenth,
turn right on Tenth. Continue on Tenth to Broad.</i></p>

<p class="pcap"><i>John Marshall House</i></p>
</div>
<h3 id="c23">City Hall</h3>
<p>The large gray stone structure on the southeast corner of Broad Street is
the City Hall. Dedicated in 1894, it was built on the site of the old City Hall,
erected in 1816 and condemned in 1874. This building contains the offices
of the Mayor, the City Manager and various municipal departments. &para;
<i>Cross Broad and continue on Tenth to Capitol Street. Turn right on Capitol
one block to Ninth. Turn left on Ninth to entrance of Capitol Square.</i></p>
<h3 id="c24">Capitol Square</h3>
<p>Commanding the driveway stands the equestrian statue of Washington,
executed by Thomas Crawford and cast in Munich at a cost of $100,000.
Chief Justice John Marshall headed the committee to raise the subscriptions,
beginning the work in 1817 when the city boasted less than 6,000 white inhabitants.
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
The monument was unveiled in 1858. Around the central figure
of Washington are statues of some of Virginia&rsquo;s famous sons, builders of the
nation as well as of their state: Patrick Henry, George Mason, Thomas
Jefferson, Thomas Nelson, John Marshall, and Andrew Lewis. It was at
the base of this statue that the second inauguration of Jefferson Davis as
President of the Confederate States of America took place, February 22,
1862.</p>

<img src="images/p07a.jpg" alt="" width="618" height="700" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Washington Monument</i></p>
</div>
<h3 id="c25">Capitol Building</h3>
<p>The central part of the Capitol was designed after the Maison Carr&eacute;e at
Nimes by Thomas Jefferson while minister to France from the United States.
The original part was commenced in 1785 and finished about 1792, and
the wings were added, to give the legislators much-needed space, in 1905.
In the rotunda in the old central part, you will see the most celebrated work
of the great French sculptor, Houdon&mdash;the life-size statue of Washington,
the only one posed from life which is in existence today. It was placed here
in 1788. Here also is a head of Lafayette by Houdon. Virginia has made
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
this rotunda her Hall of Presidents by placing here busts of her other seven
native sons who have become chief executives of the United States.</p>
<p>Opening off the rotunda is the old hall of the House of Delegates, where
Aaron Burr, in 1807, was tried for treason before Chief Justice Marshall.
In this hall occurred a great tragedy in 1870, when the balcony gave way
because too large a crowd of people had packed every inch to hear a trial
of deep local interest. Sixty-three were killed and two hundred and sixty
injured. The hall has been restored to its original appearance. Where his
statue now stands, Robert E. Lee, on April 23, 1861, accepted the command
of Virginia&rsquo;s forces. Here met the Confederate House of Representatives
from 1861-65. The present Virginia Senate and House of Delegates meet
in modern chambers in the two wings.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>State Capitol Building</i></p>
</div>
<h3 id="c26">State Buildings</h3>
<p>Leaving the Capitol by the main door, you see on the left the modern State
office building and the Finance Building on the terrace. In the basement
at the South end of the Finance Building is an interesting museum containing
exhibits of Virginia&rsquo;s natural resources, agricultural products and wild
life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<h3 id="c27">Governor&rsquo;s Mansion</h3>
<p>Swinging around the Capitol, you come to the Federal-style Governor&rsquo;s
Mansion, erected in 1811-13. From 1788 to 1811 the governors of Virginia
had to live in a two-story wooden structure, ironically called &ldquo;The Palace,&rdquo;
located on the same site as the present building. Just outside the Capitol
Square, to the north, you will see the new State Library and Supreme Court
of Appeals building. &para; <i>Leave Capitol Square by same gate through which
you entered, stopping on Grace just across Ninth.</i></p>

</div>
<h3 id="c28">St. Paul&rsquo;s Church</h3>
<p>Situated here at Ninth and Grace is St. Paul&rsquo;s Episcopal Church. General
Robert E. Lee worshipped here whenever he was in Richmond during the
War Between the States, as did President Jefferson Davis regularly. Up an
aisle to this church on Sunday, April 2, 1865, strode a messenger to President
Davis&rsquo; pew. Davis quietly left the church. The message told him that Petersburg
had fallen, that Richmond must be evacuated. The church is filled
with memorials of many kinds, and is referred to by some as &ldquo;The Westminster
of Richmond.&rdquo; &para; <i>Proceed westward on Grace to Seventh Street.</i></p>

<p>Grace Street, for several blocks west, is one of Richmond&rsquo;s newest downtown
retail shopping centers. Once a residential section, it now takes its
place with Broad Street (one block to the right) as a major business thoroughfare. &para;
<i>Turn right on Seventh three blocks to Clay. Turn left on Clay

<h3 id="c30">Monument Avenue</h3>
<p>Here begins Monument Avenue, the continuation of Franklin Street, the
newer section of the thoroughfare that has long been a main residential
street of the city. This avenue takes its name from monuments to Confederate
leaders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<h3 id="c31">J. E. B. Stuart Monument</h3>
<p>This statue by Fred Moynihan shows General Stuart, the great cavalry
leader, in a typically dashing pose. Stuart was one of the most colorful men
in the Confederacy, once riding his men eighty miles in 27 hours, another
time riding around McClellan&rsquo;s whole army&mdash;always courageous, always
gay. &para; <i>Proceed westward one block on Monument to Allen Avenue.</i></p>
<h3 id="c32">Lee Monument</h3>
<p>Only three letters mark this monument&mdash;Lee. The South felt no more were
needed. This marvelous likeness of General Lee on &ldquo;Traveller&rdquo; was sculptured
by the French artist, Jean Antoine Mercie, and was unveiled by Lee&rsquo;s
West Point classmate and friend, General Joseph E. Johnston, on May 30,
1890. Arrived in Richmond, the statue was drawn to its location by schoolchildren. &para;

<h3 id="c35">Jackson Monument</h3>
<p>This monument to Thomas J. (&ldquo;Stonewall&rdquo;) Jackson, the sculpture for
which is the work of F. William Sievers, shows him mounted on &ldquo;Sorrel,&rdquo;
facing north, because he so resolutely opposed the Northern army. Jackson,
whose brilliant strategy is studied today by soldiers the world over, was a
stern, Cromwellian type of commander in strange contrast to the dashing
Stuart. Lee called him his &ldquo;right arm,&rdquo; and no one has ever been able to
estimate the severity of the blow his death dealt the Southern cause. &para;
<i>Continue westward on Monument to Belmont.</i></p>
<h3 id="c36">Maury Monument</h3>
<p>Commodore Matthew Fontaine Maury (F. William Sievers was the sculptor
for this monument), is not as well known to the average citizen as he
deserves to be, but sailors on all the seas know his work and are grateful for
it. He is known as &ldquo;The Pathfinder of the Seas&rdquo; because he charted the
oceans with such accuracy that even today the Pilot Charts issued by the
Hydrographic Office of the Navy Department are founded on his researches.
In the house which still stands close to the present Valentine Museum,
Maury, seeking ways that would enable his pathetically small Confederate
Navy to be effective against the Union gunboats, invented the submarine
electrical torpedo. &para; <i>U-turn around the monument; proceed eastward on

collection of portraits of Confederate officers, and collections of Confederate
battle flags, arms and equipment, but is chiefly distinguished for its very
beautiful series of mural paintings of Confederate scenes by the French
artist, Charles Hoffbauer. The artist had done much of his preliminary
work when he was called back to fight for France in 1914. When he returned
to Richmond after the war, Hoffbauer painted out all he had previously
done and painted war as only one who had been through it could.
Since 1946 the Abbey has been the property of the Virginia Historical
Society. &para; <i>Proceed on the Boulevard to Grove.</i></p>

<p>This State institution, opened in January, 1936, houses the famous John
Barton Payne collections of paintings and prints; the T. Catesby Jones collection
of twentieth century European paintings, the Glasgow collection of
European Renaissance art, and the fabulous Lillian Thomas Pratt collection
of Russian jewelry. The Museum and collections are valued at more
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
than $5,000,000. In addition to its collections, it conducts a regular program
of specially assembled exhibitions, lectures and concerts. The museum
is the largest art museum in the South and has gained a national reputation
because of its biennial exhibitions of contemporary American paintings
as well as many other special exhibitions. &para; <i>Proceed on the Boulevard

</div>
<p>Virginia House, home of the late Ambassador and Mrs. Alexander W.
Weddell, is built of materials they brought from Warwick Priory, Warwick,
England, in 1925. The central section is a reproduction of the Tudor portion
of Warwick Priory, founded by the first Earl of Warwick; the right-hand
section is an exact replica of the only portion of Sulgrave Manor which
remains as it was at the time Lawrence Washington occupied it as his manor

house. The royal coat of arms may be seen over a second-story window to
your right. The arms were conferred to show that the house had given shelter
to Queen Elizabeth in 1572. The house is now the property of the Virginia
Historical Society. &para; <i>Pull up about 100 yards.</i></p>
<h3 id="c40">Agecroft Hall</h3>
<p>Agecroft was originally built in Lancashire, England, about 1393, brought
to Richmond and faithfully rebuilt here in 1925. The old plaster and timber
house was the seat of the Langleys, a branch of the royal Plantagenets. Some
of its most beautiful features are an oriel window and the great hall with
gallery for minstrels, paneled with oak and lighted by stained glass windows.
The house is eventually to go to the city as a generously endowed art museum. &para;

<h3 id="c42">Country Club of Virginia</h3>
<p>This is Richmond&rsquo;s largest country club, although there are other private
clubs and public golf courses. The Country Club of Virginia boasts one
eighteen-hole golf course and one short course at this club, and a very fine
eighteen-hole course up the James River, where the Club has another smaller
clubhouse, skeet shooting traps and river sports. &para; <i>Continue out Three

Harrison, Malvern Hill, Frayser&rsquo;s Farm, Savage Station, Fair Oaks, Seven
Pines, Cold Harbor, Gaines&rsquo; Mill, and Mechanicsville may be toured. Fort
Harrison, six miles east of the city is Park Headquarters. An interesting

<p>Historical shrines of world-wide interest, excellent transportation service,
splendid modern hotels, and every facility available for successful meetings
have made Richmond one of the outstanding convention centers of America.
Delegates attending conventions here have a wide choice of selecting their
entertainment programs. Some enjoy trips to Williamsburg, Jamestown,
Yorktown, historic Hampton Roads and Fort Monroe, the beautiful Skyline
Drive, the battlefields surrounding the city and the many diversified industrial
plants, while others participate in their favorite sport or seek diversions
in the many forms of entertainment to be had.</p>
<p>Proximity to the centers of the population, coupled with other numerous
advantages, has resulted in record-breaking attendance at meetings here.</p>
<p>In Richmond, Capital of the Old South, an industrial, commercial, educational
and financial center of the new, nothing is left undone to make every
convention meeting in this city successful and enjoyable.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>The Governor&rsquo;s Palace at Williamsburg</i></p>
</div>
<p>Only an hour&rsquo;s drive southeast of Richmond on Route 60 is the most historic
area to be found anywhere in America.</p>
<p>Here is Williamsburg, the former center of English culture in the new
world, almost completely restored to its eighteenth century appearance. Here
you will see the historic Colonial Capitol, The Governor&rsquo;s Palace and its
beautiful grounds, the famous Raleigh Tavern, the Public Gaol, the famed
Sir Christopher Wren Building of the College of William and Mary and
many other colonial structures restored through the beneficence of Mr. John
D. Rockefeller, Jr.</p>
<p>Seven miles from Williamsburg is Jamestown Island where in 1607 the
first permanent settlement of English speaking people in the New World
was established. A ruined tower of an early Colonial church still stands
here, and many interesting relics are on display in the grounds which are
under the supervision of the Association for the Preservation of Virginia
Antiquities.</p>
<p>Yorktown is only fifteen miles from Williamsburg. This famous little town
which saw a great nation come into being bears a great heritage. It was
here that proud Lord Cornwallis was forced to surrender to General George
Washington and his continental forces in 1781. The original fortifications
erected during the great siege of Yorktown have been restored. Historic
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
buildings and relics of the Revolution make Yorktown a spot which every
American citizen should visit.</p>
<p>Less than an hour&rsquo;s drive from the Colonial Williamsburg area is Hampton
Roads, an important channel through which the waters of three rivers
pass into the Chesapeake Bay. Fort Monroe, on Old Point Comfort, and
Fort Wool, on an island in the channel, defend the entrance from the Bay.
It was in Hampton Roads that the first battle between iron-clad vessels,
the <i>Monitor</i> and the <i>Merrimac</i>, took place on March 9, 1862. President
Lincoln, Secretary Seward and Confederate commissioners held their
&ldquo;Hampton Roads Conference&rdquo; on a steamer near Fort Monroe on February
3, 1865.</p>
<p>Be sure to visit Williamsburg, Jamestown, Yorktown and the Hampton
Roads area during your visit to Richmond, for nowhere else may you cover
as much historic and hallowed ground in a single day. This famous area
may be reached quickly and conveniently. Ask for information which will
facilitate your trip there.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
